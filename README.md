# kcadley/public

## üëã Welcome!

Thank you for exploring **kcadley/public**! This project exposes a number of toolkits I've developed from my private repo. It's meant to support and enable other independent traders in their algorithmic pursuits while providing a few professional examples of my work for any interested parties.



## üìñ About

**kcadley/public** is written fully in Python and designed to provide trade execution interfaces, data mining APIs, and derivatives modeling capabilities. Most toolkits are built on a variety of semi-common libraries, with one or two exceptions. Nearly every module is verbosely documented, from **help()** support on every function to inline code comments. Use case is left to the individual user, although there's likely something for everyone here (particularly the **macro** module). Traders interested in currency derivatives/spot trading that hold accounts with Oanda and TastyTrade will likely find the most broad utility, although most coders should find the underlying implementation of modules at least mildly interesting to look at. Constructive feedback is always welcome (particularly any interesting module expansion ideas you may have). Happy trading!



## üöÄ Modules
- **BOPM** - Prices European options via the Binomial Option Pricing Model
- **contracts** - Prices FX futures and options, to include Greeks & IV
- **daycount** - Implements various interest rate / trading daycount conventions
- **dxlink** - Retrieves live & historic market data from CME
- **fastoanda** - Supports trade execution against Oanda brokerage accounts. This is streamlined version of my PyPi release (https://pypi.org/project/easyoanda/), which might be worth checking out in tandum - the PyPi link provides a full how-to guide for the module and couple of tips/tricks on production ready execution.
- **macro** - Provides access to FRED, ECB, EUROSTAT, BIS, and YahooFinance databases
- **markethours** - Evaluates global market hours, determines unknown options and futures settlement / expirations dates
- **oalink** - Retrieves live & historic market data for FX currencies (spot)
- **smile** - Models an option issue's volatility smile
- **tsty** - Supports account management against TastyTrade brokerage accounts, with trade execution supported via custom payloads requests (very simple to implement, please read their datastructure guidance for requirements)
- **vol** - Provides multiple options to model historic and implied volatility of various instruments

## üôè Acknowledgments

- **Oanda** - for their fantastic endpoint documentation
- **TastyTrade** - also for their fantastic endpoint documentation
- **FRED** - for their unbelievable macroeconomic database aggregation
- **ECB** - also for their unbelievable macroeconomic database aggregation
- **EUROSTAT** - for performing broad statistic calculations over the above macroeconomic databases on behalf of the public
